git-bridge-svn: a git-svn without altering the commit hashes

git-bridge-svn is derived from git-svn with the following breaking changes:
* instead of using first-parent ancestors to find latest svn revision,
	but scans all parents
* git-svn dcommit is no longer available
* git-svn commit is used instead, which first merges the latest upstream
	changes and then pushes all local changes since the latest svn revision
	as a single svn-commit
* commit SHA is not changed on commit
* git-notes and git-tag is used to annotate the svn revisions

The bridge is not fully tested, but the commit command seems to work well.
